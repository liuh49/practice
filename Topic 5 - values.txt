For example, Nordlund and Garvill (2003) found that values were related to awareness of environmental problems and personal norms (that is, feelings of moral obligation) to reduce car use, while personal norms were the only significant predictor of willingness to reduce car use, suggesting that the effects of values on willingness to reduce car use is mediated by behavior-specific beliefs and norms.

This suggests that the influence of values on behavior is most likely to be mediated by behavior-specific beliefs, attitudes, and norms, but not by general environmental beliefs.

one could argue that values should affect ecological worldviews and environmental concern, which in turn affect behavior-specific beliefs, norms, and environmental actions. In fact, this is exactly what is proposed by the value-belief-norm theory of environmentalism (Stern, 2000; Stern et al., 1999)
